Last updated: _06/04/2024_

Thank you for choosing to use the Grocery List App, accessible from [App Distribution Platform/Company Website]. Our main priority is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that the Grocery List App collects and records and how we use it.

## Information We Collect
The Grocery List App is designed to store information locally on your device and does not collect personal information. The app allows users to create, modify, and delete grocery lists and items within these lists. All data related to your grocery lists is stored on your device and can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's data storage via your device's settings.

## How We Use Your Information
Since the Grocery List App does not collect personal information, there is no information to use other than to facilitate the app's intended functionality, which includes:

Allowing you to create, modify, and manage your grocery lists.
Saving your grocery lists locally on your device for easy access and modification.
Security
We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information. However, as the Grocery List App stores all data locally on your device, the security of your data relies on your device's security measures. We recommend keeping your device updated and protected with a password or biometric security to prevent unauthorized access.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

This policy is effective as of 06/04/2024.
